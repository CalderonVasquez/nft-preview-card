### What I learned

I have never dealt with overlays. What made this overlay so difficult is that it was not just the overlay I had  to deal with, but it also included an icon svg that needed to be centered. I had to do some research in order to add the overlay to my main image. I will definitely being looking for more resources to get a good grasp on overlays.
